# Issues I came across from coding my first email.
- Shop our deals text was pushing to the left, leaving a white margin of about 50px, had to do with the styling of the top td.
- imaging, took me a min to figure out how to get images to display on the testing, since it wasn't going to use the local path to the image file, I uploaded them on a image host and copy and paste the urls to the respected location in the html file.
